## Welcome to F# For Non-Eggheads!

So you might have some questions about F#. Such as:
### If F# is so good, why is no-one using it?
Excellent question! There are a number of reasons.

- __It's from Microsoft__
     
    Let's face it, this is enough to put a large chunk of people off, for various (mostly historical) reasons. 

- __It runs on .NET__
    
    Ah .NET. Some people just don't like .NET.
    
- __It's multi-paradigm__
    
    Microsoft already have a popular multi-paradigm language - C#.
    
- __It has a reputation for being "mathy"__
    
    All functional langauges suffer from this. 
    
- __It's not a popular language__

    Let's look at the number of subscribers to various programming language sub-Reddits:
    
    Language | Subscribers
    -------- | -----------
    C# | 153,000
    F# | 8,000
    Haskell | 23,000
    
So that's a lot of reasons not to use F#! What a good salesman you are, Mr Non-Egghead.
